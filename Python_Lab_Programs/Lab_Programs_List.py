#
# Use a nested loop to print the following pattern:
# 1
# 2 2
# 3 3 3
#
# Sum all numbers in a list using a for loop (do not use sum()).
#
# Print the multiplication table of 7 (from 7x1 to 7x10).
#
# Use a for loop with range() to print numbers from 100 to 90, stepping by -2.
#
# 10. Functions in Python (Advanced)
# Write a function with a default argument that prints "Hello, World!" unless a different message is passed.
#
# Create a function that accepts any number of numbers and returns their sum using *args.
#
# Write and use a lambda (anonymous) function to square a value.
#
# Write a function that takes another function as input and calls it.
#
# Implement a simple decorator that logs the start and end of a function call.
#
# 11. Classes and Objects
# Make a class called Student with private attributes for name and marks; then display their values using a method.
#
# Write a class with a method to change the value of an attribute after object creation.
#
# Create two objects of the same class; show they have independent data.
#
# Write a class that counts the number of its objects created so far.
#
# Create a class that takes a string and returns its reversed form through a method.
#
# 12. Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction
# Demonstrate single inheritance with a base class Animal and a derived class Dog.
#
# Show polymorphism using a speak() method in different classes (Dog, Cat).
#
# Create an abstract base class with one abstract method, and a subclass implementing it.
#
# Override a method in the derived class and call the base version with super().
#
# Write a class hierarchy for vehicles: base Vehicle, derived Car and Bike.
#
# 13. Constructor (__init__)

#
# Show how to overload the constructor using default arguments.
#
# Add a destructor method to a class and print when it is called.
